The original data underlying the article by Ben Hamed and Wang (2006) was kindly provided to List by the second author and then used in the study by List (2015). In this study, List modified the cognate judgments in such a way that the partial cognate judgments provided in Wang's original version were converted to explicit non-partial cognate judgments. For this reasons, we give both Ben Hamed and Wang (2006) and List (2015) as sources for the cognates in this dataset. The original cognate identifiers have been provided in the raw data (column WANGID), although the original data in the form originally provided by Wang is no longer available.
